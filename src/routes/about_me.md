Hi! My name is **Francisco Cunha**, and I’m a programmer with broad experience: from _web development_ to _optimization algorithms_ to _systems programming_. I'm a team player with a penchant for leadership, naturally passionate and curious, and always looking for opportunities to grow as a developer and as a person.

I'm a recent **Computer Science and Engineering** graduate from **TU Delft**, where I graduated cum laude. My time at TU Delft was incredible and taught me a lot, and now I'm ready for the next chapter in my life (maybe with your team?)

In this website you’ll find [a list of projects I’ve worked on over the years](/portfolio), both in formal settings and as personal learning experiences. You can also find more details about my academic journey and work experience by checking out [my CV](/attachments/Francisco_Cunha_CV.pdf).
