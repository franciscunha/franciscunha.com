Hi! My name is **Francisco Cunha**, and I’m a programmer with broad experience: from **web** to **operations research** to **games** – though my passion is and has always been games, which I love both as an art form and as an engineering challenge.

I’m currently in the last year of my Bachelors, studying **Computer Science and Engineering at TU Delft** as my major and **Game Studies at Leiden University** as my minor.

In this website you’ll find [a list of projects I’ve worked on over the years](/portfolio), both in formal settings and as personal learning experiences. You can also find more details about my academic journey and work experience by checking out [my CV](/attachments/Francisco_Cunha_CV.pdf).
