Jump amongst the clouds in a cute sky archipelago in this short (~20 min) 3D platformer. Find keys to progress and the optional jewels for an extra challenge. Can you reach the island at the top? Cloud Hopper was developed as a course assignment within the Game Studies minor at Leiden University. It's my very first 3D game and my first real effort in level design, but mainly it was a lot of fun to make! Hope you also have fun playing :)
