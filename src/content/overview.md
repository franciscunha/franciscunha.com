### **Alexandria**

_[Project page](/project/alexandria)_

- Developed the React/Next.js front-end for a social media website that uses Quarto projects as posts that may be authored collaboratively by multiple users.
- Led a team of 5 developers, coordinating team meetings, stakeholder communication, and managing the development process through SCRUM.
- Implemented a Dockerized workflow and GitLab CI/CD pipeline to automate builds and testing.

### **Procedural texturing for pixel art**

_[GitHub page](https://github.com/franciscunha/pixel-art-texturing)_

- Implemented an image processing tool that procedurally adds detail to pixel art. The project is written in Python using OpenCV for image manipulation.
- Developed novel method to create vector fields from simple user drawings through solving a Poisson equation,
implemented using NumPy.

### **Minimizing energy consumption in a real-life classroom assignment problem**

Co-authored [a Springer-published paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00291-022-00674-z) proposing an algorithm that reduced university energy consumption by 26% through better assigning its 3046 classes to 97 locations.

### **SACI _(en: Informatics centre's decision-making system)_**

Led development of the the SACI online platform across front-end, back-end and optimization models. SACI uses optimization-based tools for decision-making and has been used by 300+ students and faculty members

Conferece report at [Anais do Simpósio Brasileiro de Pesquisa Operacional](https://proceedings.science/sbpo/sbpo-2022/trabalhos/saci-sistema-de-apoio-a-decisao-do-centro-de-informatica-o-caso-da-ufpb?lang=pt-br#) (portuguese).

---
### **Personal website**

_[Project page](https://franciscunha.com/project/personal_website)_

Built a portfolio website using the Svelte framework, which programatically creates project pages based on a collection of markdown files.

---
### **Parallellines**

_[Project page](/project/parallellines)_

Using CUDA and C++, implemented a GPU software rasterizer from scratch to replicate OpenGL's basic functionality. It can render a 3D model with a diffuse and specular texture and a normal map, through user-defined vertex and fragment shaders.


---
### **Sortify**

_[Project page](/project/sortify)_ 

Using Rust to interface with the Spotify API, built a command line application to organize playlists.

---
### **Raytracer features**

Added several features to a custom raytracer implemented in C++: 
- Added a bounding volume hierarchy, using a surface area heuristic with binning as the splitting criterion;
- Implemented a bloom post-processing effect with a 2D gaussian filter;
- Added support for contributions of glossy reflective rays.

---
### **Evaluator assignment and scheduling problem**

Formulated and implemented an integer programming model to assign evaluators to grant proposals while simulteneously scheduling meetings amongst evaluators of the same proposal.

---
### **Meta-heuristic for the minimum latency problem**

_[GitHub page](https://github.com/franciscunha/MLP)_

Using C++, implemented the [GILS-RVND meta-heuristic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722171200269X) for the minimum latency optimization problem. Learned how to implement algorithms from scientific papers.

---
### **Cloud Hopper**

_[Project page](/project/cloud_hopper)_

Solo developed a 3D platformer using the Godot engine. Implemented two level building blocks that introduce unique gameplay mechanics, a 3D character controller, procedural level decorations, and an assortment of other gameplay features.

---
### **Ghost Swap**

_[Project page](/project/ghost_swap)_

In a two-person team, developed a 2D twin-stick shooter for the GMTK Game Jam 2023, in which it ranked 250 out of 6771 games.

---
### **Papercut**

_[Itcho.io page](https://maximecaux.itch.io/papercut)_

In a two-person team, developed a 2D stealth platformer for Ludum Dare 53.

---
### **Nibble calculator**

Used IC chips with basic logic gates to build combinatorial and sequential circuits that made up a calculator. It supports addition and subtraction operations for 4-bit numbers and has a memory capable of storing two values.

---
### **Billboard Hot 100 analysis**

Performed throughout data analysis on musical characteristics of 5100 songs that have appeared in the Billboard Hot 100 between the years of 1965 and 2015. Report is available in portuguese.

---
### **YOLO Mask detection**

_[GitHub page](https://github.com/Felipehonorato1/mask_detection)_

Built a computer vision application that used YOLOv5 to detect if someone is not using a sanitary mask, then sending a notification via Telegram bot.
