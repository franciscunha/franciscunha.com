**GHOST SWAP** is a 2D twin-stick shooter where you play two roles at the same time!

Your light ghost defeats dark enemies with projectiles, and your dark ghost can punch light enemies to smithereens. You must constantly reverse their roles to stay alive!

Ghost Swap was developed in under 48 hours for the GMTK Game Jam 2023, in which it ranked **[250 out of 6723 games](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023/rate/2159984)** (top 4%). It was developed using **Unity** in a two-person team, alongside [Maxime Caux](https://maximecaux.com/). Besides co-designing it, I did visual effects and most of the programming (except for the enemy AI).
