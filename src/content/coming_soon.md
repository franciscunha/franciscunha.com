_This website is currently a work in progress. I’m actively creating entries for projects, and so many are still missing. This page shows an overview of all projects I plan on adding to the website in the near future._

# Games

### ~~[Cloud Hopper](/project/cloud_hopper)~~

~~Solo developed a 3D platformer using the Godot engine. Implemented two level building blocks that introduce unique gameplay mechanics, a 3D character controller, procedural level decorations, and an assortment of other gameplay features.~~

### Ghost Swap

In a two-person team, developed a 2D twin-stick shooter for the GMTK Game Jam 2023, in which it ranked 250 out of 6771 games.

### Papercut

In a two-person team, developed a 2D stealth platformer for Ludum Dare 53.

# Graphics

### ~~[Parallellines](/project/parallellines)~~

~~Using CUDA and C++, implemented a GPU software rasterizer from scratch to replicate OpenGL's basic functionality. It can render a 3D model with a diffuse and specular texture and a normal map, through user-defined vertex and fragment shaders.~~

### Raytracer features

- Added a bounding volume hierarchy to a basic raytracer, using a surface area heuristic with binning as the splitting criterion.
- Implemented a bloom post-processing effect with a 2D gaussian filter.
- Added support for contributions of glossy reflective rays.

# Other

### ~~[Alexandria](/project/alexandria)~~

- ~~Using React and NextJS, developed the front-end for a collaborative platform dedicated to scientific research, with built-in discussion and peer review systems.~~
- ~~Led a 5 person team, coordinating client and team meetings, and managing the development process through Scrum.~~

### ~~[Sortify](/project/sortify)~~

~~Using Rust to interface with the Spotify API, built a command line application to organize playlists.~~

# Operations research

### Minimizing energy consumption in a real-life classroom assignment problem

Co-authored a [paper on a real life application of decision-making algorithms](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00291-022-00674-z) published in Springer's OR Spectrum.

### SACI _(en: Informatics centre's decision-making system)_

Built SACI _(en: Informatics centre's decision-making system)_, a website that uses optimization algorithms to aid in academic decision-making.

Conferece report at "[Anais do Simpósio Brasileiro de Pesquisa Operacional](https://proceedings.science/sbpo/sbpo-2022/trabalhos/saci-sistema-de-apoio-a-decisao-do-centro-de-informatica-o-caso-da-ufpb?lang=pt-br#)" (portuguese).

### Evaluator assignment and scheduling problem

Formulated and implemented an integer programming model to assign evaluators to grant proposals while simulteneously scheduling meetings amongst evaluators of the same proposal.

### Meta-heuristic for the minimum latency problem

Using C++, implemented the [GILS-RVND meta-heuristic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S037722171200269X) for the minimum latency optimization problem. Learned how to implement algorithms from scientific papers.
